<p>Myo has undergone some major design changes since it was first conceived, but the final version is about as polished as you can hope for. It’s relatively slim and sleek considering how many sensors are stuffed inside its hull, and despite being a somewhat geeky piece of gear, it does have an undeniably badass look to it. You’ll definitely stand out while you wear it, but not enough to look like a complete doofus. This isn’t Google Glass. (Although it does work with it, so if you own Glass, you can totally geek out and use both devices at once.)</p>
<p>It’s also designed to fit just about every size of forearm, regardless of whether you’ve got willowy keyboard arms like mine, or burly lumberjack limbs that you can barely fit through your sleeves. Thalmic designed the band to be stretchy, so Myo fits snugly on most arm sizes, and can be expanded with a set of spacers if you’ve got more arm to cover. So long as your forearm is between 7.5 and 13 inches in circumference (19-34 cm), you’ll be able to wear Myo comfortably.</p>

	<h3>WEARABLE TECHHNOLOGY ARM</h3>
	<img src="images/WearableTechnology arm.jpg">
	<p>Wearable Technology can come in all forms from watches, pads placed on the heart, devices worn around the arms, all the way to devices that can measure any amount of data just through touching the receptors of the device. In many cases, Wearable Technology is connected to an app that can relay the information right away ready to be analyzed and discussed with a cardiologist. In addition, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine they state, “wearables may be a low-cost, feasible, and accessible way for promoting PA.”[62] Essentially, this insinuates that Wearable Technology can be beneficial to everyone and really is not cost prohibited. Also, when consistently seeing Wearable Technology being actually utilized and worn by other people, it promotes the idea of physical activity and pushes more individuals to take part.</p>
