	<h2>Back to the future shoes</h2>
	<img src="images/back to the future shoes.jpeg">
	<p>Nike took futuristic footwear out of Back to the Future and put it into prototype with the Nike Mag, advancing what was coined the Nike Mag’s “power laces,” with digital technology. The result is an individually responsive system that senses the wearer’s motion to provide adaptive on-demand comfort and support. You can even check out a video of Michael J Fox trying them on.  With this kind of adaptive technology, it seems like the future has arrived.Anyone who has ever suffered from cold feet will be interested in Digitsole, the first-ever connected, heated insole designed for athletes and anyone who gets cold feet. The temperature of the innersole is controlled via smartphone, which can also track calories and steps. I’ve tried it on, and it does indeed warm quite well, with a maximum temperature of 113°F (45°C). It takes up to three minutes to heat and stay warm for up to 6 hours. The retail price is $199.The problem with wearables is that you have to remember to wear them. These GPS shoes inserts are designed to track people with cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer’s, Dementia, Autism and traumatic brain injuries who may forget to wear a device. </p>

	<p>A new product called Boogio is under development that will be, as far as I know, the first wearable to instrument people’s feet! Yes, this system consists of inserts for your shoes that contain sensors. These sensors provide real-time feedback on fundamental biomechanics including center of balance, foot strike zone, ground contact speed, gait symmetry, and more and communicate with a Windows, iOS, and Android apps over Bluetooth LE.Boogio smart shoe inserts quantify your posture, balance, and motion</p>
