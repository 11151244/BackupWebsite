	<p>One of the first wearable computerised devices was devised to help the user gain an unfair advantage while playing casino Roulette. This device, the forerunner of much of today’s wearable tech, although of limited potential use to the general public, was conceived to calculate probabilities on the fly. This mini-computer showed the potential of customised devices that could be turned to thousands of everyday functions: from calculators to music and entertainment devices like the Walkman, to digital hearing aids and early sports performance watches like 2003’s Garmin Forerunner. Despite the significant advance that had taken place from the simple time-telling devices of just a century before, the new generation of wearable technology was still almost exclusively in a one-way relationship with the user.</p>
	
	<h3>Wearable tech</h3>
	<img src="images/wearable tech.jpg">
<p> wearable tech is any electronic device worn on the body or inside it (as an implant, for example). Many devices have intelligence behind them; they can take input, process it, and provide meaningful output. For example, a fitness tracker takes raw data from one or more sensors, processes it, and reports the number of steps a wearer has taken over a given time. The sensors are smart enough to track a person’s motions and differentiate between steps and other kinds of body motions. </p>
	<p> Other wearables, such as smartwatches, have almost all the features and capabilities of smartphones. Newer models include fitness trackers, allowing users to do things like send and receive phone calls and texts, take pictures and videos, search the internet, pay bills, get directions, and check their activity levels. Smartglasses offer similar smartwatch features, but display information onto the lenses of eyeglasses or a heads-up display. Though not as common, but still trending, smart clothing and shoes can record a wearer’s biometrics using sensors attached to fabrics and insoles. Examples of implantable wearables include life-saving pacemakers and cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), retinal implant chips, and even microscopic sensors inside ingestible pills that relay data about a patient and the effects of prescribed medication.</p>
