<p>TOKYO -- A virtual-reality jacket that replicates the sense of touch, a belt that predicts when a pregnant mother will go into labor, and even a vest that monitors the health of your precious pooch: these are just some of the products emerging in Japan's fast-growing market for smart clothing.
	  
Teijin has developed a jacket that can simulate the sense of touch in virtual reality. Its Synesthesia Wear tracks a user's movements, and attached modules vibrate in different ways depending on how the user interacts with the VR space, adding another layer of realism to the experience.</p>
<P>The jacket also does away with the plug-in connections that made Teijin's previous version of the technology difficult to market. It is made from a specially designed fabric that conducts electricity and communications signals, letting users place the battery and haptic modules wherever they choose.

Teijin sees applications for the technology not only in gaming, but also medical areas such as physical therapy, where the jacket could collect data on the user while stimulating motor function.</P>

 <img src="images/Smart Clothes.jpg">
 <p>Technology is being developed and produced at an all-time high rate. Products that were considered as science fiction are a part of our daily lives now. Smart Clothing wearables are one such example. Smart Clothes are basically garments like shirts, socks or shoes that consists of sensors and computing devices that help track body activity and health statistics like heart rate, skin temperature, oxygen saturation etc. </p>
	<p> ABI Research, a forerunner in new technology intelligence has predicted that the smart clothing market will top 31 million device shipments annually by 2022. In contrast to 2017’s under 5 million, that’s a staggering increase. That’s a 40% CAGR. Smart Clothing will have the 2nd highest growth rate after hearable over the duration of the forecast period. Although smart clothing doesn’t have that mass market appeal, but its predicted growth will be due to its highly targeted consumer application in sports, fitness and wellness industries.</p>
